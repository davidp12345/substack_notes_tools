4. The extension icon will now appear in your toolbar for easy access

   - **LinkedIn Toggle** - Turn ON/OFF for LinkedIn posts
   - **X (Twitter) Toggle** - Turn ON/OFF for X/Twitter posts
3. Toggle settings are saved automatically and sync across your devices

### 2. Using "Edit in Notes" on LinkedIn

#### **From LinkedIn Feed**
1. Ensure LinkedIn toggle is **ON** in the extension popup
2. Browse your LinkedIn feed normally
3. Look for the orange **"Edit in Notes"** button on posts you're interested in
4. Click the button to transfer content to Substack Notes

#### **From LinkedIn Profile Posts**
⚠️ **Important**: In the "Posts" preview section of LinkedIn profiles, you must:
1. Click into the individual post first, OR
2. Go to the dedicated "Posts" page
3. Then use "Edit in Notes" - it won't work from the preview thumbnails

#### **What Gets Transferred**
- ✅ Full post text content
- ✅ Links to images (for easy re-downloading)
- ✅ External links mentioned in the post
- ✅ Post permalink for reference

### 3. Using "Edit in Notes" on X (Twitter)

#### **From X Feed**
1. Ensure X (Twitter) toggle is **ON** in the extension popup
2. Browse your X timeline normally
3. Look for the orange **"Edit in Notes"** button on tweets
4. Click the button to transfer content to Substack Notes

#### **What Gets Transferred**

- ✅ Links to embedded images
- ✅ External links and embedded content

### 4. Working with Transferred Content

#### **Auto-Population Process**
1. Click "Edit in Notes" on any LinkedIn or X post
2. Substack Notes composer opens in a new tab
3. Content is automatically populated in the editor
4. Content is also copied to your clipboard as backup

💡 **Clipboard Failsafe**: If auto-population fails, the content is already in your clipboard - just press **Cmd+V** (Mac) or **Ctrl+V** (Windows) to paste it manually. No need to go back and click "Edit in Notes" again!

#### **Media Handling**
- **Image Links Provided** - Direct links to images are included in the transferred content
- **Re-download Option** - Use provided links to re-download images and upload to your Note
- **Alternative Upload** - Delete the links and upload images directly from your own files
- **Frictionless Repurposing** - Links ensure you don't lose media when repurposing old posts

#### **Content Attribution Best Practice**
When sharing your thoughts on someone else's content:

1. After clicking "Edit in Notes", add the original poster's name
2. Put their content in block quotes to clearly indicate attribution:

```
John Smith shared an interesting perspective:

> "This is the original post content that you're responding to. 
> It helps readers understand what you're referencing."

Here are my thoughts on this...
```

This approach clearly shows you're referencing their words while adding your own commentary.

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### **Reposts/Reshares Not Supported**
- ❌ **LinkedIn Reposts** - "Edit in Notes" will fail on shared/reposted content
- ❌ **X Retweets** - "Edit in Notes" will fail on retweeted content
- ✅ **Original Posts Only** - Extension works on original content only
- 🔄 **Future Enhancement** - Repost support may be added in future versions

### **Technical Constraints**
- Content extraction relies on original post structure
- Reposted content has different DOM structure that's not currently supported
- This is a known limitation due to how social platforms structure shared content
